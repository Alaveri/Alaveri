# Alaveri Software

Alaveri Software is an organization dedicated to developing unique software and open source libraries (currently consisting of one developer, Sarah Shelby (sshelby@alaveri.org).  Alaveri is currently working on developing DOS-based libraries for Borland/Turbo Pascal and utilities aimed at producing retro-inspired games compatible with older DOS computers and DosBox.  All current public projects are released under the MIT license.

### Current Projects

#### ADL

The ADL (Alaveri DOS Library) is a library for DOS and Borland/Turbo Pascal.  Features include memory management including XMS, mouse and keyboard handling, graphics including VGA and SVGA, streams, lists, drivers, and general object-oriented utilities.  The ADL is currently under active development.

#### Verda

Verda is a text-based GUI library for DOS and Borland/Turbo Pascal 7.  Features to include a text mode desktop including windows, menus, buttons, lists, trees, dialog boxes, editors and more.  Normal text modes are supported, and optionally mixed VGA/SVGA-based graphics/text modes, allowing higher resolutions than 80x25 text (for example 100x37 text mode in SGVA 800x600). Verda runs in DOS real mode and allows fast development of DOS GUI applications without needing Windows 3.1 or other operating systems.  Verda utilizes the ADL to make automatic use of XMS memory if detected, large data-sets, images or other information limited only by available XMS memory.  Verda is currently under active development.

Future plans include adapting it to use optional full graphical rendering without changing any existing app using Versa, other than switching out the rendering driver.

#### Alaveri TextDraw

Alaveri TextDraw is a DOS-based ANSI and ASCII text editor, using mixed text/graphic modes, using VGA/SVGA rendered graphics.  Panned features include creating images, tile-sets and animations. TextDraw is written in Borland Pascal 7 using the ADL and Verda libraries.  Alaveri TextDraw is currently under development.

System Requirements:

- 512k RAM
- VGA or SVGA graphics card

Recommended:

- 386 compatible PC  
- Math Coprocessor
- Available XMS memory (2 MB or more)
- VESA-Compliant SVGA card supporting 800x600 or higher

or
- DosBox on a modern computer system.  The S3 SVGA driver is recommended.

### Future Projects

#### Alacrity Scripting Language

Alacrity is an interpreted scripting language for DOS and Borland/Turbo Pascal.  It is being designed with simplicity, readability and low memory requirements for use in games and other DOS applications.  Alacrity is planned, but not yet under development.

The above open-source projects are intended for use in designing a yet unnamed Role-Playing Game engine and design tools, and a new retro-inspired Sci-Fi RPG with a complex story and engaging game play.  The game design tools will be available under open source using the MIT license, but the first game for the new engine will likely be closed.
