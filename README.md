# Alaveri Software

Alaveri Software is an organization dedicated to developing unique software and open source libraries.  Alaveri is currently working on developing DOS-based libraries for Borland/Turbo Pascal and utilities aimed at producing retro-inspired games compatible with older DOS computers and DosBox.  All current public projects are released under the MIT license.

### Current Projects

#### ADL

The ADL (Alaveri DOS Library) for DOS and Borland/Turbo Pascal.  Features include memory management including XMS, mouse and keyboard handling, graphics including VGA and SVGA, streams, and general object-oriented utilities.  The ADL is currently under active development.

#### Veridian

Veridian is a GUI library for DOS and Borland/Turbo Pascal.  Features to include a graphics desktop including windows, menus, buttons, lists, trees, dialog boxes, editors and more.  Veridian runs in DOS real mode and allows fast development of DOS GUI applications without needing Windows 3.1 or other operating systems.  Veridian utilizes the ADL to make automatic use of XMS memory if detected, large data-sets, images or other information limited only by available XMS memory.  Veridian is currently under active development.

#### Alaveri Draw

Alaveri Draw is a DOS-based 256-color VGA editor for creating images, tile-sets and animations, written in Borland Pascal 7 using the ADL and Veridian libraries.  Alaveri Draw is currently under development.

System Requirements:

- 386 compatible PC  
- 512k RAM
- VGA 256 color graphics

Recommended:

- Math Coprocessor
- Available XMS memory (2 MB or more)
- VESA-Compliant SVGA card supporting 640x480 @256 color or higher

#### Alacrity Scripting Language

Alacrity is an interpreted scripting language for DOS and Borland/Turbo Pascal.  It is being designed with simplicity, readability and low memory requirements for use in games and other DOS applications.

### Future Projects

The above open-source projects are intended for use in designing a yet unnamed Role-Playing Game engine and design tools, and a new retro-inspired Sci-Fi RPG with a complex story and engaging game play.  The game design tools will be available under open source using the MIT license, but the first game for the new engine will likely be closed.
